# Program 03 – Conway’s Game of Life (SDL2 Edition)
### Write up by Nicole Vigilant

I transformed my earlier terminal-based version of Conway’s Game of Life into an interactive graphical application using SDL2 for this project.The primary objective was to maintain the original logic of ConwayLife while incorporating a GUI that allows users to engage with the grid in real time. I created an SDL2 window that visualizes the simulation with filled rectangles, updating according to the traditional Game of Life rules. The program features options to pause and resume the simulation, advance one generation at a time, clear the grid, generate a random starting state, and exit the application. Additionally, I included mouse functionality so users can activate or deactivate cells by clicking anywhere on the grid. In addition, the program loads Life patterns from a JSON file. I used `shapes.json` to store a glider pattern and implemented functionality to place the pattern at the mouse position when the user presses the “1” key. This demonstrated the ability to parse JSON, extract data, handle user input, and merge pattern data into the current grid.

One of the more challenging parts of the assignment was getting SDL2 configured correctly inside MSYS2, especially linking the correct libraries to avoid errors during compilation. Another challenge was converting mouse pixel coordinates into grid cell indices and making sure the program ignored clicks outside the valid grid area. Implementing the JSON pattern loader also required careful attention to detail. I needed to correctly interpret the structure of the JSON file, convert coordinate values into integers, center the pattern around the cursor, and ensure patterns did not spawn outside the grid boundaries.

If I were to further develop this project, I would think about incorporating optional features like changing color themes, modifying simulation speed, using drag-to-paint for drawing, zooming functionalities, or implementing a wrap around grid effect. These features would enhance the interactivity and visual appeal of the simulator. Additionally, I would investigate the possibility of adding on-screen HUD text through SDL_ttf. Overall, this project has helped me grasp the integration of object-oriented programming with graphical rendering and event driven design. Transitioning from a terminal based version to a fully interactive SDL2 application has made the simulation feel significantly more dynamic and has deepened my comprehension of real time graphics programming.
